# 📎 PDF Merger Tool

An elegant, drag-and-drop powered web app that allows users to merge multiple PDF files into one — built using Flask (Python), PyPDF2, and Vanilla JavaScript.

This tool provides a seamless and interactive user experience, allowing you to:

🧩 Combine multiple PDF documents into a single file

📂 Upload files via drag & drop or file picker

🚀 Instantly download the merged output without storing any user data

Whether you're organizing your notes, bundling project reports, or sending multiple PDFs as one — this tool makes it quick, clean, and code-free.

🔒 Privacy First: All files are processed temporarily and auto-deleted after merging. No data is stored on the server.
